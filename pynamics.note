Dear Getpaid/Pynamics,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Rhondel Pagobo, and I am a student currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science and Information Technology at Northwestern Mindanao State College of Science and Technology. I am writing to inquire about the current suspension of your API service and its potential impact on my Capstone Project.

As part of my academic requirements, I am undertaking a Capstone Project that heavily relies on the functionality provided by your platform's API service. Unfortunately, I recently learned about the suspension of the API service, which has raised concerns about the continuity and successful completion of my project.

I have invested considerable time and effort into developing and integrating your API service into my project, as it offers essential features and data necessary for achieving the objectives of my Capstone Project. Given the current status of the API service, I am now uncertain about its availability during the crucial phases of my project development.

Therefore, I kindly request information regarding the duration of the API service suspension. Could you please provide me with an estimated timeline for when the service is expected to be reinstated? This information is of utmost importance to me as it will allow me to assess the potential impact on my project's timeline and make any necessary adjustments to my development plans accordingly.

Additionally, if there are any alternative solutions or workarounds that I could explore during the API service suspension period, I would greatly appreciate any guidance or assistance you could provide.

I want to assure you that I value your platform and the services it offers, and I am eager to continue utilizing your API for my Capstone Project once it becomes available again. Your prompt response to this matter would be immensely beneficial to me in planning the next steps for my project.

Thank you for your attention to this inquiry. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Rhondel M. Pagobo
